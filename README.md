# Marvin

Marvin is a powerful CLI tool designed to help Kubernetes cluster administrators 
ensure the security and reliability of their environments. 

Using a comprehensive set of [CEL (Common Expression Language)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) expressions, 
Marvin performs extensive checks on cluster resources, 
identifying potential issues, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities that could pose a risk to the system. 
It helps ensure that your Kubernetes clusters are always in compliance with best practices and industry standards.
